the most important point of css to understiand is every thing is a box, Every element in HTML is a rectangular box. by default every element in html generate a box, and this box may be a block level box or inline box.

CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes â€” algorithms which determine the size and position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor boxes:

block layout, designed for laying out documents

inline layout, designed for laying out text

table layout, designed for laying out 2D data in a tabular format

positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document

This module introduces a new layout mode, flex layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.
